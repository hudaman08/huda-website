              <li>If you'd rather not dive into political topics, stay clear of the Election Thoughts section</li>

        <div class = "writing" id = "electionText">
          <p>Last night, Donald Trump won the US presidential election. As the night was developing a flood of emotions started to course through me. I wanted to try and distill a few of those thoughts and feeling as best I could.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>What bothers me most is that people think inclusion, open mindedness, and "western values" broadly are a given. They aren't. We aren't pre-ordained to US exceptionalism, we've made choices to achieve it. We've made sacrifices to achieve it. When individuals lack the will to contribute to the collective betterment, progress retreats, the pie stops growing, and we all are made the worse for it.</li>

            <li>I have always been a minority. It seems like a stupid statement to make, but we all live at any given moment in different aspects of our being. Luckily perhaps I rarely experience the world as a minority even if that is at times how the world experiences me. Today, however, I have never felt like more of a minority (even when part of a voting majority). A minority in race. A minority in religion. A minority in intellect. A minority in politics. A minority in hope for collective action and achievement.</li>

            <li><p>Taking a knee at the end of the game, is something reserved for the victors of the battle between the lines. The victory formation that serves as a rare moment of celebration before the contest is technically over. This is the type of knee that Colin Kaepernick hasn't taken much over the past couple years since the departure of Jim Harbaugh. And yet, when Kap's now more famous kneeling started gaining traction, I viewed this too as a victory. A victory for respectful protest. A victory to athletes using their voices to try and drive social change in the mold of Mohammed Ali and many before him.</p>

            <p>Any yet, a couple days after an election which may have brought American values to her knees (insert profane Trump joke her), Kap admitted to not having taken part in the election, saying that it would be hypocritical. And in this moment any points scored by Kap's protest were all taken off the board. Did you find both candidates equally viable and aligned to your 'causes' that you post of Instagram? Unlikely? Even if you did, what about the litany of ballot measures in California this year, 17 in all? At a moment where Kap could have inspired many to marry protest with a path to voicing your opinion in line with democratic values, he instead took a knee.</p></li>

            <li>Hilary Clinton may have lost the election tonight, but she was not the biggest loser. The real loser this election cycle has been facts. The entire premise of 'enlightened' societies is that facts matter. Information matters. An educated populace matters. Until it doesn't. This isn't just a chink to the armor of the western 'experiment,' this is a violation of one of the fundamental tenants that democracy is based on. When a population not just tolerates but rewards someone who unabashedly tells lie after lie, who is left to hold him accountable?</li>

        <p>It's become almost a trite statement to say that the elderly become increasingly like children as they age. Needing constant care and help and losing a lot of the autonomy built up in adulthood. That being said, it doesn't mean we can't find humor in moments this reality rears its head. </p>

        <p>A few days ago, when over at my grandparents, we had reached the "playing cards" part of the standard visit agenda. The whole agenda goes something like:
          <ol>
        	<li>Food</li>
        	<li>Presents (if the occasion warrants)</li>
        	<li>Dessert (and tea/coffee it's lunch)</li>
        	<li>Playing cards</li>
        </ol></p>

        <p>This time though, we decided to change it up and rather than playing the traditional brown variant on spades/trumps to teach our grandparents a new game. The first try was rummy. The first try was not successful. Too much strategy, too many rules. So noted, let's downgrade to Uno… </p>

        <p>Side note: of all the variant versions of Uno, I think we might have found the worst. It was a batman theme, which was insanely busy. The colors blended into each other. The 1's all had a portion of green, even when they were other colors… Definitely not easy for a child, err the elderly to learn… "What color is this? Yellooowww. Can you say yellowww? Good grandma!"</p>

        <p>And here is where time started to bend back on itself. First comes my grandpa complaining when she had to draw cards. Pretend as she might that she didn't know the rules or card about the game, she knew one thing more cards = bad. Her solution turned out to be much the same as mine years ago, well if I'm not winning I don't want to play! After coaxing her to keep "playing" (with heavy assistance from my aunt), the tides of the Uno fortunes turned in her favor! Suddenly she was down to one card. Uno! Next up is my grandpa (again with the aunty assist). The choice was clear and the move was right out of the "How to deal with childhood Shawn Playbook." My a reverse in the color my grandma needed to win. How fortuitous!</p>

        <p class = "ssTitle"> The Three Person Time Zone </p>
        <p>I get to my grandparent's house around 6. Later than we want to, but you don't care about that. On the drive over my sister told me that their prayer time is 6:30. That's weird I say to myself, but hey they're old, maybe they need to sleep early or something. When I get to the house though, it gets weirder. The grandparents are constantly asking what time it is and seeming confused by my answer. Then one of them has the audacity to go to the bathroom in their room. "Oh no!" my aunt exclaims "There's a clock in there…" Seeing my confusing, I finally get the whole story.</p>

        <p>In an effort to build an ample cushion for my grandparents to get ready for whatever they might be going (let's be real its just the doctors, jamatkhana, or family at this point), my aunt has set all the clocks back an hour and created a timezone of 3 people. 7:30 prayer time now happens at 6:30 pst. A 11am doctors appointment in the real world is still at 11am GPT (grandparent time), but really that means they're aiming or an imaginary 10am appointment in PST. They say that our body takes about a day to acclimate to a new time zone. Does that still hold true when the time zone is 15 mins from your house?</p>
