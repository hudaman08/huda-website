    <h2> MERRY CHRISTMAS... LET'S PLAY</h2>
    <div class="intro-wrapper">
      <div class = "intro">
        <p>
          Merry Christmas and welcome to the 2017 version of the Christmas gift reveal. Since Ayushi Santa wanted this year's gifts to focus on getting to know each other, I figured I would play along.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fun fact about me: I'm learning to code, and figured I could use this as a way to practice
        </p>
        <p>
          So for this game we will be testing how well everyone knows Sujata. Here are the rules:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            There will be a series of questions about Sujata. For each question, Sujata gets to pick one person to answer the question. Choose carefully since you can only pick a person once!
          </li>
          <li>
            If you guess incorrectly, fear not, there will be a series of hints to help you along the way
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you get the question right, you get to open the corresponding "gift" (the gifts are numbered). You have a timer to get it unwrapped so no dilly dallying!
          </li>
          <li>
            After you open the gift, you will be presented with a task that must be completed before you can proceed to the next question. Since X-Mas is a family affair, you can elicit help from the audience with the tasks
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          HAVE FUN!
        </p>
